Install ElasticSearch
========================================================================================================================================================
Non-secure Cluster.

     1. Download ElasticSearch 7.6+ from https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-7-6-0

     2. Extract the zip file and go to config/ folder
     
     3. Open elasticsearch.yml file and edit network.host to your ip.
	network.host: 10.97.24.124

     4. You may config network.port if you can't use default 9200 port.

     5. Uncomment discovery.seeder_hosts and set your seed hosts such as discovery.seed_hosts: ["<ip_address>","[::1]"]

     6. You also can config any settings in the yml file if it is required(like number of replicas etc..)

     7. cd back to bin folder and just run ./elasticsearch 


========================================================================================================================================================
Secured cluster:

     You'll have to enable X-pack and enable security functions in elasticsearch.yml file.

     1. In order to enable security it is necessary to have either a Gold or Platinum subscription, or a trial license enabled via Kibana or API. For 
example, the following command would enable a trial license via the API:

 curl -X POST "localhost:9200/_xpack/license/start_trial?acknowledge=true"
         Where localhost must be replaced with the name of a node in our Elasticsearch cluster.

     2. After enabling a license, security can be enabled. We must modify the elasticsearch.yml file on each node in the cluster with the following line:
        xpack.security.enabled: true

     3. Create certs file
        bin/elasticsearch-certutil ca ENTER ENTER
        bin/elasticsearch-certutil cert --ca elastic-stack-ca.p12 ENTER ENTER ENTER

     4. The newly created certificates should be copied into a sub-directory called certs located within the config directory. The certificates will 
then be specified in the elasticsearch.yml file as follows:

        xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true 
        xpack.security.transport.ssl.verification_mode: certificate 
        xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.path: certs/elastic-certificates.p12 
        xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore.path: certs/elastic-certificates.p12
     5. Built-in users passwords can be setup with the following command:

        bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords interactive
        Currently I gave elastic for all password. this will be used when you login host:9200 url.

     6. Http/ssl encryption (in elasticsearch.yml)

        xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: true
        xpack.security.http.ssl.keystore.path: certs/elastic-certificates.p12
        xpack.security.http.ssl.truststore.path: certs/elastic-certificates.p12
        xpack.security.http.ssl.client_authentication: optional

     7. Enable PKI authentication 
         xpack.security.authc.realms.pki1.type: pki

     8. As a whole, a final configuration that needs to be added in elasticsearch.yml file will be like below:

         xpack.security.enabled: true
         xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
         xpack.security.transport.ssl.verification_mode: certificate
         xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.path: certs/elastic-certificates.p12
         xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore.path: certs/elastic-certificates.p12

         xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: true
         xpack.security.http.ssl.keystore.path: certs/elastic-certificates.p12
         xpack.security.http.ssl.truststore.path: certs/elastic-certificates.p12
         xpack.security.http.ssl.client_authentication: optional
         xpack.security.authc.realms.pki1.type: pki

     9. restart elastic search from bin(./elasticsearch)


ElasticSearch commands:
========================================================================================================
Pre-requist:
1. In order to run ElasticSearch snapshot and restore, you need add below property
   path.repo: ["<PATH_TO_WHERE_YOU_WANT_SAVE_BACKUP>"]
   in your elasticsearch.yml(<ElasticSearch_HOME>/config) and restart elasticsearch
2. Open elasticsearchtool and set BACKUP_LOCATION, ELASTICSEARCH_HOST, ELASTICSEARCH_PORT and BACKUP_REPO_NAME(if you want to change)
Steps:
1. ./elasticsearchtool -p (create backup repo, you only need create repository once)
2. ./elasticsearchtool -s snapshot_1 (create snapshot_1, you can create multiple snapshots)
3. ./elasticsearchtool -r snapshot_1 (restore snapshot_1)
4. ./elasticsearchtool -d tcta_transaction_bcce (delete index)
